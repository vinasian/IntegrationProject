   * This calculator uses int, double, String, boolean. the int is used for the case code when
   * choosing an operation double is the input, the number that is to be calculated string is to
   * make a statement then the answer to save time. string is also used as the input type so the
   * boolean function can work. boolean here is used to check whether the input is a number.
